# Furhat Support Code provisions

A repository containing supporting material and code such as Furhat skills to reproduce issues I encounter with Furhat robots. - In the hope to find out whether I did something wrong or it's a real issue.

Not meant for public consumption; will be turned private if anything with doxing potential comes up.

So far, the issue descriptions live in the closed slack channel / in e-mails, so the stuff contained in this repo should

be harmless.
